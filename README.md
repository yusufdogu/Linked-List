In this code, we implement a basic singly linked list in C. It includes the following functionalities:

1-Add a node at the end of the list: Appends a new node with the specified data to the end.
2-Add a node at the beginning of the list: Inserts a new node with the specified data at the start.
3-Add a node at a specific position: Inserts a new node with the specified data at a given position in the list.
4-Delete a node from a specific position: Removes the node at the specified position.
5-Reverse the entire list: Reverses the order of the nodes in the list.
6-Print the list: Outputs all the elements in the list.
This program allows you to build and manipulate a linked list through a simple command-based interface.
